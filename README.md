## Courses
### 1. CS50's Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University
The link to the course can be found here [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

CS50 is a 10 weeks course, where it starts off with Dr David Malan introducing computer science at the very top level. The course continues with introducing a few different languages for different purposes. Scratch was taught to give us some impressions of programming, then C was taught to teach us about data structure, algorithm, efficiency, memory and pointer. Finally, Python was taught to focusing on web development using the Flask framework. Throughout the courses, we have different programming assignments every week and finish off with a final project on week 10. For my final project, I have created a web application called MyTime-MyResponsibility. A video of me introducing the application can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6YiyP2a2Pc&feature=youtu.be).


### 2. Machine Learning by Stanford University
The link to the course can be found here [Machine-Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

This is a 11 weeks course, introducing what is machine learning and how it works. This course deals with a lot of equations so having an okay understanding of algebra made me struggle "less" to complete the course. Basically, this course taught me on how machine learning can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised problems. Dr Andrew Ng also taught me on how to select suitable algorithms to solve a particular problem by evaluating the algorithms based on suitable criterias. There are quizzes and programming assignments at the end of each week where the quizzes test us on the understanding of the lecture and the programming assignments test us on applying what we have learned to solve problem. Some of the assignments are predicting housing prices, image recognition, anomaly detection and recommender system.
